= More features with Patrons Tips Pro =

**[Patrons Tips Pro](https://patronstips.com/en/downloads/patrons-tips-pro/?utm_source=wp-plugin-page&utm_medium=wordpress&utm_content=readme)** allows you to restrict your content **to patrons of the month of their publication**. 

If you published a restricted post/image/product in July 2025, then only people who were patrons in July 2025 will be able to see it. **Newcomers will never have the permission to see it**. 

*This way, you will no longer give access to all the content you have created to the first person who comes along.*

This feature **protects your work and increases its value** and is **exclusive to Patrons Tips Pro**, no other patronage system offers it.

**Patrons Tips Pro** also includes many features:

* Restrict posts, medias and products by tier **to patrons of the month of publication**
* **Restrict the availability** of one or more tiers to offer limited premium rewards
* Display monthly **stretch goals** (number of patrons or amount of money) to encourage more backers to contribute
* Manually **add patrons** from the back office
* Manually **manage your patrons' history**, you can change, revoke and subscribe patrons to any tier, any month
* Patrons can choose their **own nickname** which will be displayed in patron lists
* Give your patrons annual badges to **reward their loyalty** and make them feel special
* Send **automatic reminder emails** when a patronage expires (with WooCommerce)

**[Purchase Patrons Tips Pro here](https://patronstips.com/en/downloads/patrons-tips-pro/?utm_source=wp-plugin-page&utm_medium=wordpress&utm_content=readme)**.


= How is Patrons Tips different from crowdfunding platforms such as Patreon or Tipeee? =

* Patrons Tips is **free**: there are neither fees nor commissions on sales.
* Patrons Tips is **independant**: you and your patrons are not locked into a platform and its terms (pricing, features, policies, etc.) for life.
* Patrons Tips **settles on your website** : customize your site and its features using WordPress plugins.


= This plugin is perfect for... you ? =

This sponsorship system was specifically created to meet the needs of **most independant creators**:

* **Artists** (painters, cartoonists, photographers, 3D artists...)
* **Video makers** (youtubers, streamers...)
* **Authors** (reporters, writers, bloggers...)
* **Musicians** (composers, singers, instrumentalists...)
* **Performers** (humorists, dancers, circus artists...)
* **Podcasters** (hosts, interviewers...)
* **Cosplayers** (tailors, models...)
* **Developers** (video games creators, web developers...)
* **Craftspeople** (plush makers, ceramists, jewelers...)
* **Advisers** (speakers, experts...)
* **Sportspeople** (athletes, coaches...)
* and maybe you!

If you want to be financially supported for your creative work, then you should give it a try!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I use Patrons Tips on an existing website? =

Of course! You can restrict old and future content with existing or new tags and categories. And you can also specify a launch date so that your older content won’t be affected.

= I am not a creator, can this plugin still meet my needs? =
Yes, you can use Patrons Tips as a simple membership plugin. It basically allows you to restrict content and unlock it for subscribers, so you can find another use for it.

= Pricing comparison with other platforms =
**Patreon**: 10% commission + taxes
**Tipeee**: 8% commission
**Buy Me a Coffee**: 5% commission
**Ko-Fi**: 5% commission
*(Last update : July 2025)*

**Patrons Tips**: **completely free**

We believe that **everyone should pay the same price for the same service**. This price souldn't raise based on your success, let alone without any limits, which is why we will never charge commissions on your sales. Earning money is already a huge challenge!

**Patrons Tips is completely free** to let everyone get started, and [Patrons Tips Pro](https://patronstips.com/en/downloads/patrons-tips-pro/) is offered at a **one-time, fixed annual fee** for as long as your subscription is active. We want to help other creators make a living.

= Why choose Patrons Tips over Patreon, Tipeee, etc.? =

**Your patrons want to support you**, not the patronage platform you're using.

Think about it, **what will happen if you are successful?**

By choosing one of these online platforms, **you will bring them more than they bring you** (advertising, revenue, members), their fees will soar, you will depend on them, you will no longer be able to leave them, **even if their conditions no longer suit you (prices, features, policy, etc.)**, because it is where your entire community will be.

Whereas by using Patrons Tips on your own site, you

* Preserve your **independence** and your **ethics**
* Maintain **total control** over your costs, your income, and the functioning of your patronage
* Keep **your patrons**, your community, and their subscriptions on your side, on your own site
* Receive your earnings directly into your own bank accounts (with WooCommerce)
* **Customize** your site at your convenience
* Add the **features** you need anytime with WordPress plugins
* Store all **your data** on your own server

= Is WooCommerce mandatory? =

No, it’s not. Patrons Tips works on its own: you can build a *free* or *offline paid* community of supporters. But we recommend using it as it was first designed to work perfectly with WooCommerce to get financial support. Moreover, you can automatize revenue with a subscription plugin.

= Can I use Patrons Tips as a donation plugin? =

Sure, you don't have to offer benefits if you just want a tip system that allow your fans to donate and help you with a financial support. You can use Patrons Tips to make a well-designed page with different price points so that every tipper finds a reasonnable choice.
